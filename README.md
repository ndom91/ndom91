## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nico Domino, command-line warrior and open sourcerer. My day job consists of an eclectic mix of full stack web development, sys admin, and dev ops responsibilities. In short, I keep the wheels turning here at [Newtelco](https://newtelco.dev).

### Currently Working On...

I am currently working on a redesign of our homepage (old - [`newtelco.com`](https://newtelco.com), new (staging) - [`newtelco.dev`](https://newtelco.dev)). The original site was built on wordpress by a third-party freelancer. Since I've got a good bit of experience in the [jamstack](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/) world, I wanted to bring that in-house and replace it with a headless CMS based site. After narrowing down the surprisingly large field of headless CMS providers, our new Gatsby + DatoCMS project was [born](https://github.com/newtelco/newtelco-dato)ðŸŽ‰!

I also started another project recently, a warehouse / inventory management type application called [Katalog](https://github.com/ndom91/katalog) ðŸ“¦. I'm developing and releasing it as an open source project so all contributions are welcome and I hope others find it useful as well!
